# App4Api

## About
This repository contains the front end for the APP4API application developed for Digital Social Science Center at Columbia Unviersity.
The goal of this code is to provide a web interface for the backend code developed in java. This front end is developed using 
java, jsp, css, and html. The basic template is inspired from W3 layouts. Each code contains couple of lines at the top that talk about
the utility of the code. The code and the interface is very minimalistic. The project is a maven dynamic web project and hence all the dependecies
are pulled from the maven repository. The only dependency that is has to be added is from the GeoCodeAPI repository. The jar generated 
from that repository has to be included in the build path of this file and the entire project can be run in Tomcat.
